To build the project please run the following:

./autogen.sh && ./configure && make 

The built program "mdsim" is created in "src" directory. You can test it with
example load configuration. To do so run the following:

cat ./tests/test.conf | ./src/mdsim

It prints out some diagnostic output, which is expected to be as follows:

loop counter 5
server MDS0

It parses the loop described in test.conf and runs the load on described
MDS0 server. This is not much but some working piece of parser. We will add
more later.

Todo:

1. Make syntax of load config less "heavy" and pascal like;
2. More constructions to create more sophisticated loads;
3. More text UI in mdsim.
